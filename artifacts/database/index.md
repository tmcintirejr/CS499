# Database Integration Enhancement

This folder contains enhanced files demonstrating database integration using SQLite.

- [Driver.java](Driver.java)
- [DatabaseUtility.java](DatabaseUtility.java)

### External Library Used

To enable database connectivity, I used the [SQLite JDBC Driver](https://github.com/xerial/sqlite-jdbc).

This `.jar` file was required to interface with the SQLite database from within Java. It was added to the project under a `lib/` directory during development. You can download the latest version of the driver from the official repository:
