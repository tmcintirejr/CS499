## 👋 Greetings!

I’m **Tim McIntire**—U.S. Army veteran, long-time Fire Medic on Alabama’s Gulf Coast, and freshly minted B.S. Computer Science graduate from Southern New Hampshire University.  
Over the last three years I have transformed a lifelong fascination with technology into demonstrable expertise in software engineering, full-stack development, and secure cloud architectures.  
This self-assessment introduces the strengths, values, and career goals showcased throughout the ePortfolio that follows.

---

### 🛠️ 1. Coursework, ePortfolio & Professional Growth

Developing this ePortfolio forced me to revisit, refactor, and *defend* every major project in the CS program—​turning each assignment into a polished artifact that quantifies my readiness for industry.

| Strength | Coursework Example | ePortfolio Proof |
|----------|--------------------|------------------|
| **Modular OOP Design** | *IT-145* rescue-animal project → redesigned with inheritance & interfaces | “Software Design & Engineering” enhancement |
| **Algorithmic Thinking** | *CS-300* & *CS-305*: optimized sort/search labs | HashMap refactor in “Algorithms & Data Structures” |
| **Secure Data Persistence** | *CS-340* & *CS-465/470* full-stack capstones | JDBC + SQLite integration in “Database Integration” |

Together these artifacts form a single, iteratively improved codebase—​mirroring how real teams evolve production software over time.

---

### 🤝 2. Key Professional Competencies

| Domain | Demonstrated Ability |
|--------|----------------------|
| **Collaborating in Team Environments** | Led Git workflows and peer-code-reviews in *CS-250* & *CS-255*; comfortable with Agile ceremonies and Jira/GitHub Projects. |
| **Communicating With Stakeholders (CO 2)** | Converted technical specs into UML, sprint demos, and client-ready slide decks; my capstone code-review video translates refactor decisions for non-developers. |
| **Data Structures & Algorithms** | Reduced lookup time from *O(n)* to *O(1)* by migrating ArrayLists → HashMaps; implemented BSTs, recursion, and dynamic programming in course labs. |
| **Software Engineering & Databases** | Full-stack MERN app (*CS-465/470*), RESTful APIs, and secure JDBC data layer; emphasize SOLID principles, unit tests, and CI/CD. |
| **Security Mindset** | Used OWASP guidelines in *CS-305 Software Security*; parameterized SQL, input validation, and exception handling protect the rescue-animal system from injection and logic-bomb exploits. |

---

### 🎯 3. Career Aspirations & Values

I aim to **transition into a Software Engineer or Full-Stack Developer** role at organizations that value:

* **Public-service impact** (e.g., first-responder tech, smart-city infrastructure, or GovTech vendors like *Hexagon* or *Tyler Technologies*).  
* **Cloud-native innovation**—I am pursuing *AWS Solutions Architect* and *Microsoft Azure Developer* certifications to complement the cloud work completed in CS-470.  
* **Responsible AI**—my final elective (*CS-370 Current/Emerging Trends*) ignited an interest in pairing generative-AI endpoints with secure backend services.

---

### 🔗 4. How the Artifacts Fit Together

1. **Software Design & Engineering** – establishes a clean, scalable OOP foundation.  
2. **Algorithms & Data Structures** – boosts performance without altering external behavior.  
3. **Database Integration** – adds persistent, secure storage, completing the full data-flow.

Because these enhancements build on the *same* codebase, reviewers can trace a clear, incremental evolution—exactly how professional teams iterate in production.

---

### 📈 5. Ready for Industry

Combining a decade of high-stakes emergency experience with rigorous computer-science training, I bring:

* Calm, mission-focused teamwork under pressure.  
* A proven habit of **continuous refactor** and **security-first** thinking.  
* A portfolio that *quantifiably* demonstrates my ability to design, optimize, and secure real software—ready to add value on day one.

I’m excited to apply these skills as a **software engineer who never stops learning and always delivers dependable code that serves people first.**
