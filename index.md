ðŸŽ“ Tim McIntireâ€™s ePortfolio
Welcome to my professional ePortfolio for the SNHU Computer Science Capstone. This portfolio showcases my growth, skills, and achievements in the field of computer science. It includes enhanced project artifacts across the three major areas of study and my professional self-assessment.

ðŸ“„ Professional Self-Assessment
Timothy McIntire â€“ CS 499 Capstone â€“ Southern New Hampshire University

As I complete my Bachelorâ€™s in Computer Science at Southern New Hampshire University, the development of this ePortfolio has given me a powerful opportunity to reflect on how far Iâ€™ve come and to showcase my readiness to enter the field as a competent, values-driven, and adaptable professional. The coursework, projects, and capstone experiences throughout this program have allowed me to apply technical knowledge in ways that emphasize my strengths: modular software design, secure database integration, performance optimization, and thoughtful, user-centered programming practices.

Professional Growth and Career Alignment
Throughout the program, Iâ€™ve sharpened my ability to solve real-world problems using scalable software solutions. My goal has always been to transition into a role that not only values clean architecture and efficient code but also requires strong analytical thinking and a collaborative spirit. Each course and projectâ€”particularly this capstoneâ€”has further solidified my passion for software engineering and backend development. Iâ€™ve learned that the smallest design choices, such as how to structure an ID system or refactor duplicated logic, can have wide-reaching effects on code clarity and maintainability.

Technical Competency and Key Skills
My coursework and professional development have touched on all the critical domains of computer science:

Collaborating in a Team Environment
Though this capstone was completed independently, my academic journey has required regular group collaboration. In earlier courses like IT 200 and CS 250, I partnered with classmates to create class diagrams, document shared codebases, and present project outcomes. These experiences taught me to respect diverse workflows, communicate ideas clearly, and maintain version control across multiple developers.

Communicating with Stakeholders
Iâ€™ve written technical documentation, presented UML diagrams, and translated user requirements into implementation plans. This ability to bridge technical and non-technical audiences is something I continued to hone in the capstone, especially when planning enhancements that preserved the original application structure for easier review and grading.

Data Structures and Algorithms
I demonstrated algorithmic thinking in this capstone by replacing linear searches with HashMap lookups, reducing time complexity from O(n) to O(1). In earlier courses like CS 300 and CS 405, I implemented stack/queue structures, recursion, and binary search trees, giving me the foundational understanding to make strategic choices when optimizing software.

Software Engineering and Database
I have extensive experience in modular design, object-oriented programming, and persistent data storage. In the capstone, I refactored classes into abstract and inheritance-based structures, replaced duplicated logic with reusable methods, and integrated a secure SQLite database using the JDBC API.

Security
In multiple projects, including this one, I prioritized input validation, data integrity, and secure database handling. I used parameterized queries to protect against SQL injection, structured exception handling for reliable execution, and carefully separated database logic from core functionality to reduce vulnerabilities.

Portfolio Integration and Artifact Summary
This portfolio consists of three major enhancements to a single Java application, originally developed in IT 145. Together, these enhancements showcase the evolution of the projectâ€”and of my skillsetâ€”across three major domains:

Software Design & Engineering
I refactored the codebase to support modular OOP principles, added support for six animal kingdoms, and created a scalable ID system.

Algorithms & Data Structures
I replaced inefficient ArrayList searches with HashMap collections for constant-time lookups.

Database Integration
I created a dedicated utility class to integrate SQLite, enabling persistent animal records across sessions with secure, parameterized database interactions.

Together, these artifacts highlight the full range of my abilitiesâ€”from architectural planning to algorithmic efficiency to real-world database implementationâ€”and serve as a strong introduction to my work as a computer scientist. I look forward to applying these skills in a professional setting, whether in software engineering, backend systems, or technical solutions architecture.
