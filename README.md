## About Me

## About Me

**Greetings!** Iâ€™m **Tim McIntire**â€”a U.S. Army veteran and career **Fire Medic** with 10 years of frontline service along Alabamaâ€™s beautiful Gulf Coast. Outside the station, Iâ€™m a lifelong tech-enthusiast who just completed a **B.S. in Computer Science** at SNHU, adding to an earlier **A.S. in Computer Animation** from Full Sail University.

My day-to-day work demands calm problem-solving under pressure, clear communication, and rock-solid teamworkâ€”traits I now channel into **software development, full-stack engineering, and network design**. Iâ€™m a creative builder at heart, overflowing with ideas for mobile apps that make life safer, smarter, and more connected.

Off duty, youâ€™ll find me with my amazing wife of 11 years and our three energetic sonsâ€”usually tinkering with side projects or coaching the boys through their first lines of code.

If youâ€™re looking for a developer who pairs disciplined service with imaginative thinking, letâ€™s connect!
